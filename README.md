# CSE-635-NLP-Sentiment-Analysis-using-RNN
Sentiment Analysis using Different RNN/LSTM Architectures as a part of the course CSE 635 (Natural Language Processing and Text Mining) at the University at Buffalo.

This project was created and implemented as an individual one under this course.
The overall code structure and conceptual information was provided by the Course Instructor and TAs.

Dataset used was the IMDb and python libraries for the sentiment analysis were PyTorhc and TorchText.

Below models were implemented:
- pre-trained word embeddings (fasttext)
- 3 different RNN/ LSTM architectures
  - multi-layer uni-directional RNN
  - multi-layer bidirectional RNN
  - multi-layer bidirectional LSTM
- regularization
- optimizer
